# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## Who is this app for?
The app is aimed at three audiences:
- **Recruiters**: As a portfolio project demonstrating my development skills.
- **Students**: As a learning resource to explore how modern desktop applications are built.
- **Myself**: It’s based on the Excel spreadsheet I’m already using, so I plan to use the app when it’s stable.

## Who am I?
Probably the hardest question, but... I’m Mauro, a 34-year-old help desk analyst from Argentina. I’ve been coding as a hobby since I was a teenager and recently I’ve been looking for a related job in software development.

### Why a ledger app?
First, because I want to automate my actual spreadsheet. Second, because I wanted to implement a CRUD application, and this is a great example of one.

### Why use React?
My recent education includes an advanced course in full-stack web development using React, Angular, and Node.js. I consider this project a *web project*.

### Why use Electron?
Electron allows packing the *back end* and *front end* into a single standalone application and establishes a kind of API between them using its Inter-Process Communication (IPC).

### Why a desktop app?
Because it’s easier to showcase—no need for development servers, web services, or API keys. Just run the app.

### Why SQLite?
To make the app fully portable and independent. It stores the database in a single file on the hard drive, so it doesn’t require a separate server, making it ideal for this project’s use case.
